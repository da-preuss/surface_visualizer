# Surface Visualizer

This repository contains an implementation of visualizer for the pressure of a ship's propeller using Python and OpenGL.

## Building and Running

You need to have Python installed and added to your path. Officially supports Python 3.9.
To build the project, execute `setup.bat`. After that, you can run the program by executing `run.bat`. 

## Controls

You can rotate the view by pressing and holding the `left mouse button` and translate the view by pressing and holding the `right mouse button`. 
With the `scroll wheel`, you can zoom in and out. `R` resets the view, `W` toggles wireframe mode, `1`-`4` swap between the different pressure percentages, 
and the `left` and `right` arrow keys change the triangulation plane.
